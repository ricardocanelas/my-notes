# How to Speak English Fluently in 1 Week

Fluency comes with practice. Practice is a must. If you think you read well so you be fluent as well, but reading and speaking are very different.

Listening will improve your speaking capabilities hugely. You will learn the correct pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, accent, and intonation. All human beings learn a language by listening.

Remember to always read a book that is of your level. Reading English can get downright weird! Why? 'read' and 'read 'have the same spelling but different meanings as well as pronunciations. Reading takes patience. Do not try rushing through the book or newspaper. Conecentrate on every word that you read.
