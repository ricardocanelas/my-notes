# Tips

1. Mastered the writing process - It's about knowing **the structure**, **format**, **organization**, **process** and **brainstorming**.

2. Read as much as you can.

3. Grammar - grammar is the foundation of writing.

4. Keep a journal

If you're not sure what to write about, here are some ideas:
- Write about your day, an interesting event, how you're feeling, or what you're thinking.
- Make up a conversation between two people. You can be creative with this!
- Write a letter to a friend, yourself, or a celebrity. You don't need to send it; just writing it will be helpful.
- Translate a text you've written in your native language into your foreign language.
- Write a review or a book you've recently read or a move you've recently watched.
- Write a script for a speech, podcast, or - for the creative ones out there - you can even write a script for your own play or short film!
- Write Facebook statuses or Tweets (whether you post them or not will be up to you)!
- Write a short story or poem.
- Think about mistakes you've made in your foreign language and re-write them correctly or talk about how you would approach them differently in the future.
