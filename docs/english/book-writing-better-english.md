# Obligations

*When you use one of the auxiliaries with a verb, you tell 'to what degree of obligation' someone has to carry out the action of the verb.*

The first one shows the *least degree of obligation*. The last sentence shows the *greatest degree of obligation*:

* We may return the books. *(Least obligation. It’s our choice.)*
* We can return the books. *(Little obligation. It’s our choice.)*
* We are able to return the books. *(Little obligation. We have the ability to do this.)*
* We need to return the books. *(Slight obligation.)*
* We ought to return the books. *(Little obligation. But this would be a good idea.)*
* We should return the books. *(Little obligation. But this would be a good idea.)*
* We are supposed to return the books. *(Some obligation. Someone has suggested we do this.)*
* We must return the books. *(Greatest obligation. It is our duty to do this.)*
* We have to return the books. *(Greatest obligation. It is our duty to do this.)*

When you add an auxiliary to a sentence, you should use the same tense as the original verb. For example:

- *“John found a good book.”* [past tense]
- *“John had to find a good book.”* [past tense with 'have to']
