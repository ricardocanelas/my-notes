?> **Book:** Atomic Habit (by James Clear)

James clear began publishing articles since November 2012. He began by publishing a new article every Monday and Thurday. In 2017 he lauched the Habit Academy, which is a training platform. In 2018 he wrote this book.

This book will share a step-by-step plan for building better habits. It's an operating manual. The four-step model of habits:

1. cue (deixa, sinal de entrada)
2. craving (desejo, √¢nsia)
3. response (resposta)
4. reward (recompensa, pr√™mio)

There is **no one** right way to create better habits, but this book describes the best way that James Clear knows.

Others ways:

- B.F. Skinner, he was a psychologist, behaviorist: stimulus, response, reward.
- Charles Duhigg, author of *The Power of Habit*: cue, routine, reward

# The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

**Why small habits make a big difference**. If you can get 1 percent **better** each day for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done.

Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who you could be. The most powerful outcomes are delayed. You need to be patient.

**Forget about goals, focus on system instead**. Goals are about the results you want to archive. System are about the processes that lead to those results. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress.

Example:

- If you are an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns.
- If you are a student, your goal might to write better. Your system is how to improve your grammar, get new ideas, read books, etc.

The problems with focus on goals:

- Winners and losers have the same goals
- Achieving a goal is only a momentary change
- Goals are at odds with long-term progress
- Goals restrict your happiness - *'Once I reach my goal, then I'll be happy'*

# How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

Three Layers of Behavior Change

![image_behavior_change]

-      | Outcomes | Processes | Identity
------:|----------|-----------|----------
About  | ..what you get | ..what you do | ..what you believe
Concerned | with changing your results | with changing your habits and system | changing your beliefs
Most Associated | Goals | Habits | Beliefs, assumptions, biases
Example | Losing weight | Eating healthy food | Your self-image

*Directions:*

![image_behavior_change_directions]

- | Outcome-based habits | Identity-based habits
--|---------------------|------------------------
Description | The focus is on what you want to achieve | The focus is on who you wish to become
Type of person | I'm the type of person who *wants* this | I'm the type of person who *is* this
Example when offered a smoke |"No thanks. I am trying to quit" | "No thanks. I'm not a smoker"
- | They set goals (to stop to smoke) and determine the actions to archive | They set beliefs (not be a smoker) and determine the actions to archive
- | Goals drive their actions | Beliefs drive their actions

Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity

* The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to *become* a reader
* The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to *become* a runner
* The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is *become* a musician

### **CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY**

The word *identity* was originally derived from the Latin word *essentitas*, which mean *being* and *identidem*. Your identity is literaraly your 'repeated beingness'.

It is a simple two-step process:

1. Decide the type of person you want to be
   - You need to know who you want to be
   - The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identiy associated with that behavior.
   - Each experience in life modifies your self-images
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins
   - Each time you write a page, you are a writer

üí¨ Ask yourself - Who is the type of person that could write a book? It's probably someone who is consistent and reliable.

# How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

In summary: the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward (which satifies the craving and and become assosciated with the cue).

- **The cue**: triggers your brain to initiate a behavior (problem)
- **The craving**: they are the motivational force behind every habit (desire)
- **The response**: it is the actual habit you perfom (actions)
- **The reward**: It is to satify your craving. (the end goal)
   - The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving
   - The second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future

### Examples

Cue | Craving | Response | Reward
----|---------|----------|---------
Your phone buzzes with a new text message | You want to learn the contents of the message | You grab your phone an read the text | You satisfy you craving to read the message. Grabbing your phone becomes associated with your phone buzzing.
You wake up | You want to feel alert | You drink a cup of coffee | You satisfy your craving to feel alert. Drinking coffee becomes associated with waking up
You smell a dougnut shop as you walk down the street near your office | You begin to crave a doughnut | You buy a doughnut and eat it | You satisfy your craving to eat a doughnut. Buying a doughnut becomes associated with walking down the street near your office
You walk into a dark room | You want to be able to see | You flip the light switch | You satisfy your craving to see. Turning on the light switch becomes associated with being in a dark room

### How to create üëç

1. Cue - Make it obvious - How can I make it obvious?
2. Craving - Make it attractive - How can I make it attractive?
3. Reponse - Make it easy - How can I make it easy?
4. Reward - Make it satisfying - How can I make it satisfying?

### How to break ‚úã

1. Cue - Make it invisible
2. Craving - Make it unattractive
3. Response - Make it difficult
4. Reward - Make it unsatisfying

### **THE HABIT SCORECARD**

It is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a noconscious habit to a more conscious level. To create your own scorecard, make a list of your daily habits. It a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.

Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself:

- Is this a good habit? **+**
- Is this a bad habit? **-**
- Is this a neutral habit? **(empty)**

actions | level
--|-------
Wake up |
Turn off alarm |
Check my phone | -
Go to the bathroom |
Take a shower  | +
Brush my teeth | +
Get dressed |
Make a cup of coffee | +
Smoking while drinking a coffee | (I don't know because if I smoke, then it will reduce stress)
...and so on |

If you still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question to use: *Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?*

- Remember: habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good.
- Tip: If you want to break a bad habit, just speak aloud before you do the action, this make the consequences seem more real.

### **THE BEST WAY TO START A NEW HABIT**

The **two** most common cues are **TIME** and **LOCATION**.

-        | I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]
---------|--------------------------------------------------
Studying | I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my bedroom
Exercise | I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym
Marriage | I will make my partner a cup of coffee at 8 a.m in the kitchen

Many human behavior follow this cycle. You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing. Each action becomes a cue that trigger the next behavior. One of the best way to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called *habit stacking*.

-        | After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]
---------|--------------------------------------------------
Exercise | After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately change into my workout clothes
Meditation | After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute.
Gratitude | After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I'm grateful for that happened today.
Mariage | After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a kiss

or you can stack situation

-        | When [SITUATION], I will [NEW HABIT]
---------|--------------------------------------------------
Exercise | When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of using the elevator
Social Skills | When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself someone I don't know yet
Finances | When I want to buy something over R$ 500, I will wait twenty-four hours before purchasing

When and where you choose to insert a habit into your daily routine can make a big difference. Consider when you are most likely to be succesful.

### **MOTIVATION IS OVERRATED; ENVIRONMENT OFTEN MATTERS MORE**

People often choose products not because of **what** they are, but because of **where** they are. Your habits change depending on the rrom you are in and the cues in front of you. Envrionment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.

In humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous system. We perceive the world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, **is vision**. Some experts estimate that half of the brain's resources are used on vision. For this reason, a small change in what you **see** can lead to big shift in what you do.

Knowning about it, make the habits obvious. For example: if you want to create a habit to reading, put a book where you can see when you are relaxing.

Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.

Remember, our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships.
