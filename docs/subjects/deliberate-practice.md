Deliberate Pratice

# James Clear's blog

Hogan said, “I couldn't wait to get up in the morning so I could hit balls. I'd be at the practice tee at the crack of dawn, hit balls for a few hours, then take a break and get right back to it.”... For Hogan, every practice session had a purpose.

> Um exemplo. Quando você aprendeu a dar nó no cardaço do tenis, você estava atendo em cada etapa do processo. Depois de varias repetições, você não precisa ficar mais atendo em cada etapa, certo? Isto se tornou um hábito, faz sem pensar, sem ficar atendo. Isso é um inimigo da pratica deliberada.

This is because the natural tendency of the human brain is to transform repeated behaviors into automatic habits. For example, when you first learned to tie your shoes you had to think carefully about each step of the process. Today, after many repetitions, your brain can perform this sequence automatically. The more we repeat a task the more mindless it becomes.

Mindless activity is the enemy of deliberate practice. The danger of practicing the same thing again and again is that progress becomes assumed. Too often, we assume we are getting better simply because we are gaining experience. In reality, we are merely reinforcing our current habits—not improving them.

Deliberate practice always follows the same pattern: break the overall process down into parts, identify your weaknesses, test new strategies for each section, and then integrate your learning into the overall process.

There are many ways to receive feedback. Let's discuss two. The first effective feedback system is measurement. The second effective feedback system is coaching.

If you can't win by being better, then win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it much easier to stand out regardless of your natural abilities.

## The Repeated Bout Effect

The more you repeat a behavior, the less it impacts you because you become accustomed to it.

> Se você fizer supino hoje, amanha você estará com dores. Se você fizer supino leve, você vai acostumar a dor e vai fazer com que o corpo se recupera mais rápido. Na proxima semana que fizer supino, você não terá a mesma dor. Um outro exemplo seria tomar café. Se você nunca tomou café na vida, e tomar, você vai sentir o efeito da cafeina, porem se você está tomando café há anos, logo o efeito será menor.

3 Lessons On Improvement:

- First, doing a light amount of work is a great way to reduce the pain of difficult sessions.
- Second, the amount of work that you need to do to reach your maximum level of output is higher than what you are doing now.
- Third, deliberate practice is critical to long-term success.

> Começar leve vai reduzir a dor. Continuamente ir para próximo level, aumentando os estimulos.

### Writing Skill - Deliberate Pratice

- Benjamin Franklin

He began by finding a publication written by some of the best authors of his day. Then, Franklin went through each article line by line and wrote down the meaning of every sentence. Next, he rewrote each article in his own words and then compared his version to the original. Each time, “I discovered some of my faults, and corrected them.” Eventually, Franklin realized his vocabulary held him back from better writing, and so he focused intensely on that area.
